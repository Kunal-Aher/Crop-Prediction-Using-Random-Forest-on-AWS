# Crop-Prediction-Using-RandomForest-on-AWS
This project develops a crop prediction model using RandomForestClassifier, deployed on AWS to provide scalable, data-driven insights for farmers. By analyzing factors like soil, rainfall, and temperature, the model offers accurate and reliable recommendations, optimizing crop selection and productivity. 
Random Forest ensures robust performance, handling large datasets, missing values, and complex relationships while minimizing overfitting.
